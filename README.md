# DataMining
Repository for algorithms used in data mining and artificial intelligence (linear regression, logistic regression etc.).

Each file is numbered by the last digit of its name.

First file contains well known and classic word count problem (with computation of tf-idf weights).

Second file contains various considerations about linear regression.

Third file contains problems involving classification algorithms (logistic regression, KNN, decision trees, random forests etc.).

Fourth file contains algorithms for text classification (without usage of neural networks) and image classifiaction (either 
simple neural networks and convolutional neural networks).
